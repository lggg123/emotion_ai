# Sentiment Analysis Tutorial

## What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining or emotion AI, is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information1. It involves analyzing large volumes of text to determine whether it expresses a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment, or a neutral sentiment2.

Sentiment analysis is widely applied to various materials such as reviews, survey responses, online and social media posts, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine1. With the rise of deep language models, more complex data domains can be analyzed, including news texts where authors typically express their opinion or sentiment less explicitly1.

The objective and challenges of sentiment analysis can be shown through some simple examples1:

Simple cases: “I love this product.” (Positive sentiment)
More challenging examples: “I do not dislike this product.” (Negation handling, positive sentiment)
Advanced, “beyond polarity” sentiment classification looks at emotional states such as enjoyment, anger, disgust, sadness, fear, and surprise1.
Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies to train computer software to analyze and interpret text in a way similar to humans2
